"""Louvered roof / bioclimatic pergola cover calculation.

Tiltable lamellas lying in a (near-)horizontal overhead plane, rotating about a
single horizontal axis. Unlike the venetian (tilted) engine — a slat pack in a
vertical plane parallel to a window, where ``higher sun ⇒ more closed`` — an
overhead louver tracks only ONE sun component (the projection into the plane
perpendicular to the rotation axis) and has a *max-light* pose (edge-on) with
shade poses on either side of it.

The control objective is **occupancy shading**, not slat-edge tracking: keep a
protected plane lifted ``h`` off the ground (e.g. 1.80 m) over the pergola
footprint in shade. Each cycle the engine decides between two modes:

* **Max-sunlight** — edge-on pose ``θ = p`` (only the slat thickness shades).
* **Max-shade** — the **minimal-block ("just barely") pose**: block the beam
  with a small fixed overlap and no more, so airflow is maximised. A beam at
  signed profile angle ``β`` is blocked by any pose ``|θ − β| ≥ Δ_eff``, where
  ``Δ_eff`` (see :meth:`_delta_eff`) is the grazing half-angle inflated so the
  shadow lands a fixed ``_BLOCK_OVERLAP_MARGIN_CM`` onto the next slat. The pose
  depends on which side of an axis end the sun is on:

  * **Tracking side** (``|γ| ≤ 90``): the reachable grazing pose nearest vertical
    (most open). Around solar noon the steep/far side (past vertical) is nearest
    vertical and vents while blocking the high sun; near an axis end the steep
    side runs off travel, so the flat overlap side takes over (the axis-end
    pinch). ``shade_airflow`` off restricts this to the flat side only.
  * **Past-axis wing** (``|γ| > 90``, the morning/evening reopening): the same
    most-open just-barely pose, capped at vertical — ``min(β − Δ_eff, vertical)``.
    The flat grazing edge rises as the sun sets; once it passes vertical, vertical
    is the most-open pose that still blocks (going past would imply the sun from
    below). The near-flat axis-end pinch reopens toward vertical.

Mode selection (per cycle):

1. Sun below the elevation gate → the cover is not ``direct_sun_valid`` so the
   pipeline parks it at the default position (night handling — done upstream).
2. Sun in the configured blind-spot (deadzone) → **max-sunlight** (an external
   object such as a house already shades the area).
3. Otherwise compare the horizontal shadow shift from the roof (``H``) down to
   the protected plane (``h``) against the footprint depth along the sun's
   azimuth: ``Δr = (H−h)/tanα`` vs ``D = Lx·|sinAz| + Ly·|cosAz|``.
   ``Δr ≥ D`` (sun too low, area side-lit, slats useless) → **max-sunlight**;
   ``Δr < D`` (beams come through the roof onto the protected area) →
   **max-shade**.

When the sun crosses an axis end (``|γ| > 90°``) the pose switches from the
tracking-side just-barely rule to the past-axis perpendicular rule, so the slats
come back down from the far-side vent to track the crossed-over beam to vertical
at sunset instead of staying pinned open. The chosen angle is clamped to
``[theta_min, theta_max]`` and mapped to 0–100 % through the (optionally
nonlinear) tilt calibration.
